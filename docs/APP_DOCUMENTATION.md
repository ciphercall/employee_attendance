## 1. Project Overview

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **App Name** | PPHL Attendance System |
| **Display Name (Android)** | PPHL Attendance |
| **Package / Application ID** | `com.pphl.employee_attendance` |
| **Organization** | PPHL (Peoples Poultry & Hatchery Ltd.) |
| **Platform** | Android (Flutter cross-platform, only Android targeted) |
| **Purpose** | Employee attendance tracking with on-device face recognition and GPS verification |
| **Version** | 2.0.0+2 |
| **Dart SDK** | ^3.11.0 |
| **Flutter Channel** | Stable (3.41.2) |
| **APK Size** | ~85.9 MB (latest arm/arm64 release build) |

### What the App Does

1. Employee logs in with email/password (currently dummy auth).
2. Employee registers their face via **5-capture multi-angle registration** (straight, left, right, up, down) with **live camera angle detection** — the system only captures when the face matches the target angle (stored on-device).
3. To check in for attendance, the employee:
  - Opens the check-in screen which activates the **front camera live preview** inside a human face-shaped container.
  - Must first place the face correctly inside the guide (size + centering gate) before any challenge can progress.
  - Completes **dynamic randomized liveness challenges (up to 5)** from the check-in page: look straight, smile, blink, turn left, turn right.
  - A **clockwise progress animation** fills around the face-shaped container as each accepted challenge is passed. If identity is verified early, remaining steps are skipped and the ring completes with a **green tick**.
  - The app verifies face identity using a **strict core-template threshold (~80% to 82% quality-aware)** with weighted top-k scoring over registration templates.
  - Identity approval requires **core consistency across multiple registration templates**; adaptive templates are supporting-only and cannot approve identity by themselves.
  - Verification uses **multi-attempt capture retry** (2 attempts during early checks, 3 attempts in final verification) and keeps the best confidence.
   - GPS location is captured and reverse-geocoded.
4. Dashboard shows attendance stats, weekly hours chart, and recent history.

## 4. App Architecture

### Pattern
The app uses a **simple stateful widget architecture** without a state management library. Each screen manages its own state via `StatefulWidget` + `setState()`. The face recognition service is a **singleton** accessed directly.

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **No backend** — All data is local. Authentication is simulated. Face data is stored in `SharedPreferences`.
- **Singleton service** — `FaceRecognitionService` uses `factory` + `_internal()` pattern for a single instance across the app.
- **On-device ML** — No network calls for face recognition. ML Kit + TFLite run entirely on-device.
- **Camera via camera package** — Uses the Flutter `camera` package for live camera preview directly within the app. For registration, the system detects face angles in real-time and auto-captures. For check-in, challenges are evaluated live with a circular progress animation.

### Data Flow

```
User → Login (dummy) → MainShell → [Home | Attendance | Notifications | Profile]
                                      │                                    │

## 5. Navigation Flow

```
LoginScreen
  └─(Sign In)→ MainShell (IndexedStack with BottomNavigationBar)
                  ├── Tab 0: HomeScreen
                  │     └─(Clock-In Card)→ CheckInScreen → (pop on success)
                  ├── Tab 1: AttendanceHistoryScreen
                  ├── Tab 2: NotificationsScreen
                  └── Tab 3: ProfileScreen
                        ├─(Register Face)→ FaceRegistrationScreen
                        └─(Sign Out)→ LoginScreen (pushAndRemoveUntil)
```

- **MainShell** uses `IndexedStack` to keep all 4 tab screens alive.
- **CheckInScreen** is pushed as a `MaterialPageRoute` from HomeScreen and pops after success.
- **FaceRegistrationScreen** is pushed from ProfileScreen's "Quick Actions → Register Face" card.

| **Tabs** | Home, Attendance, Alerts, Profile |
| **Nav Bar** | Custom `Row` of `GestureDetector` items with animated containers, rounded corners on the bar itself |
| **Screen Stack** | `IndexedStack` — all screens stay alive |

### 6.3 HomeScreen (`home_screen.dart`, 545 lines)

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **State** | `StatefulWidget` (tracks `_isClockedIn`, `_checkInTime`) |
| **Header** | Gradient card with avatar, greeting (dynamic AM/PM), today's check-in/out/hours |
| **Quick Stats** | 4 `StatCard` widgets: Present (18), Absent (1), Late (2), Leave (1) |

| **Weekly Chart** | `BarChart` from `fl_chart` showing Mon–Sun hours |
| **Recent Attendance** | List of top 5 `AttendanceTile` widgets |

### 6.4 CheckInScreen (`check_in_screen.dart`, ~1260 lines)

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **State** | `StatefulWidget` with `TickerProviderStateMixin` |
| **Props** | `VoidCallback onCheckIn` — called on success |
| **Layout** | Fixed top (camera + face-path progress), scrollable middle (challenge status, verification/GPS cards), fixed bottom (action button) |
| **Camera** | Live front-camera preview using `camera` package, displayed inside a human face-shaped clip container (normal non-mirrored orientation) |
| **Flow** | Face-placement-gated dynamic challenge flow. See [Check-In Flow](#check-in-flow) below |

#### Check-In Flow

| Phase | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **Initializing** | Camera + FaceRecognitionService initialization, verify face is registered |
| **Scanning** | Live camera preview active. Each step is gated by face placement (must be centered and sized correctly in the face guide). Placement validation uses actual captured frame dimensions (not only preview metadata), includes width/height orientation fallback, and uses check-in centering tolerance tuned to ±35%. Liveness challenges run in randomized order with periodic `takePicture()` every 700ms. |
| **Verifying** | Early verification starts only after at least **2** challenges are passed (up to 2 captures). If a match is found, remaining steps are skipped; otherwise scanning continues. If all challenges are consumed, a final verification runs with up to 3 captures and best-confidence selection. |
| **GPS** | Face verified → capture GPS coordinates via `Geolocator` (high accuracy, 15s timeout) → reverse geocode address |
| **Success** | All steps complete → "Done ✓" button pops the screen and calls `onCheckIn` callback |
| **Error** | Any failure → error card + "Retry" button resets challenges |

#### Liveness Challenges (up to 5, randomized order)

| Challenge | Detection Method | Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| **Look Straight** | `isTargetAngle(face, FaceAngle.straight)` | \|yaw\| < 14° AND \|pitch\| < 14°, held for 2 frames (~1.4s) |
| **Smile** | `isSmiling(face)` | `smilingProbability ≥ 55%` |
| **Blink** | State machine: eyes open → eyes closed → eyes open | `leftEyeOpenProbability` + `rightEyeOpenProbability` thresholds |
| **Turn Left** | `isTargetAngle(face, FaceAngle.left)` | yaw in [15°, 55°], held for 2 frames |
| **Turn Right** | `isTargetAngle(face, FaceAngle.right)` | yaw in [-55°, -15°], held for 2 frames |

#### Face-Path Progress Animation

- Custom `_FaceScanProgressPainter` draws a clockwise progress path around a human face-shaped guide
- Progress fills in 20% increments for each accepted challenge and can jump to completion on early verification
- Track color: white 15% opacity; progress color: `AppColors.primary` (blue) → `AppColors.success` (green) when complete
- On 100%: `ScaleTransition` with `Curves.elasticOut` shows a green circle with checkmark icon
- Stroke width: 5px (track) / 6px (progress path) with rounded caps/joins

| **Camera** | Live front-camera preview using `camera` package in normal non-mirrored orientation, with face-shaped guide and progress ring |
| **Flow** | Delete old registration → Auto-detect angle 1 (straight) → Auto-capture → Angle 2 (left) → ... → Angle 5 (down) → Done |
| **Angle Detection** | Periodic `takePicture()` every 700ms → face placement gate (orientation-robust width/height fallback + ±28% centering tolerance) → live quality gate (also evaluated with orientation fallback) → `isTargetAngle(face, targetAngle)`. When target angle is held for 2 frames (~1.4s), auto-captures. |
| **5 Angles** | Straight (\|yaw\|<14, \|pitch\|<14), Left (yaw 15–55°), Right (yaw -55– -15°), Up (pitch 9–45°), Down (pitch -70– -6°) |
| **Same-Person** | Each new embedding checked against all previous captures via cosine similarity ≥ 65% |
| **Quality** | Every step is pre-validated in live analysis (`checkFrontCamera` placement + `checkFaceQuality`) before angle hold/capture. Capture-time validation still runs via `registerFaceCapture()` pipeline. |
| **UI** | Step indicator dots (5), camera preview with face-shaped overlay (`_FaceOvalOverlayPainter`), animated face-path progress ring (`_FaceRegistrationProgressPainter`), angle icon + instruction overlay, capture flash animation, completion overlay with green checkmark, progress list card, tips card, done button |

### 6.6 AttendanceHistoryScreen (`attendance_history_screen.dart`, 349 lines)

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **State** | `StatefulWidget` with `_selectedFilter` (All/Present/Absent/Late/Leave) |

| **UI** | Each notification tile has icon mapping (alarm→warning, check_circle→success, etc.) and read/unread state |

### 6.8 ProfileScreen (`profile_screen.dart`, 472 lines)

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **State** | `StatelessWidget` |
| **Sections** | Header (avatar, name, designation, employee ID), Personal Info card, Quick Actions (Leave Request, View Reports, **Register Face**, My QR Code), Settings (Notifications, Location, Dark Mode, Language, Password, Help, About), Sign Out |
| **Face Reg** | "Register Face" quick action card navigates to `FaceRegistrationScreen` |
| **Sign Out** | `pushAndRemoveUntil` → `LoginScreen` |

### 7.3 Processing Pipeline

#### Registration Pipeline (per capture, 5 angles)

```
Live Camera Preview (front, non-mirrored, periodic takePicture every 700ms)
  → ML Kit Face Detection (accurate mode, minFaceSize 0.25)
    → Placement Gate: face must be centered and correctly sized in guide (orientation-aware width/height fallback)
    → Live Quality Gate: quality checks must pass before step progression
    → Angle Detection: isTargetAngle(face, targetAngle)
    → Must hold target angle for 2 frames (~1.4s)
    → Auto-capture when angle matches
    → Reject if 0 faces or >1 face
    → Front Camera Validation (face ratio ≥ 6%; centering required for straight capture, relaxed for non-straight captures)
    → Face Quality Check (size, centering, eyes open; rotation checks SKIPPED for non-straight angles)
    → Sharpness Check (Laplacian variance ≥ 15.0 on face region)
    → Same-Person Check (cosine similarity ≥ 65% against all previous captures)
    → Crop face (40% padding, make square)
    → Generate 4 embedding variants (original, mirrored, grayscale, grayscale+mirrored)
    → Average variant embeddings
    → L2 normalization
    → Store in SharedPreferences
    → If final capture (5th): compute averaged embedding, store alongside individuals, clear adaptive templates
```

#### Verification Pipeline (check-in with live challenges)

```
Live Camera Preview (front, face-shaped container, non-mirrored display)
  → Periodic frame analysis (takePicture every 700ms)
  → Placement Gate: face must be centered and correctly sized in face guide (orientation-aware width/height fallback)
  → Randomized Liveness Challenges (dynamic, up to 5):
    1. Look Straight — isTargetAngle(straight), hold 2 frames
    2. Smile — smilingProbability ≥ 55%
    3. Blink — state machine: eyes open → closed → open
    4. Turn Left — isTargetAngle(left), hold 2 frames
    5. Turn Right — isTargetAngle(right), hold 2 frames
  → Clockwise face-path progress ring fills as accepted steps complete
  → After at least 2 completed challenges: early `verifyFace()` attempt (up to 2 image captures)
    → If matched: skip remaining challenges, show completion tick, continue to GPS
    → If not matched: continue with next challenge
  → If all challenges are used without early match: final verification (up to 3 image captures)
  → Full embedding pipeline:
    → ML Kit Face Detection
    → Reject if 0 faces or >1 face
    → Front Camera Validation
    → Face Quality Check
    → Sharpness Check (Laplacian variance)
    → Crop → variant embeddings (normal/flipped/grayscale) → averaged embedding
    → Load stored average embedding from SharedPreferences
    → Cosine similarity against average + each registration embedding (core)
    → Weighted top-k aggregate on core templates (top1 60%, top2 25%, top3 15%)
    → Require core consistency (minimum core-hit count) plus quality-aware threshold (~80% / ~82%)
    → Evaluate adaptive-template similarity only as supporting signal (not approval source)
    → On high-confidence core success: auto-save embedding as adaptive template (deduped, rolling max 20)
  → GPS capture (high accuracy, 15s timeout)
  → Reverse geocode
  → Success
```

| `left` | yaw ∈ [15°, 55°] |
| `right` | yaw ∈ [-55°, -15°] |
| `up` | pitch ∈ [9°, 45°] |
| `down` | pitch ∈ [-70°, -6°] |
| `unknown` | Does not match any of the above |

#### ChallengeType
| Value | Instruction |
|---|---|
| `lookStraight` | "Look straight at the camera" |
| `smile` | "Smile! 😄" |
| `blink` | "Blink your eyes" |
| `turnLeft` | "Turn your face slightly left" |
| `turnRight` | "Turn your face slightly right" |

### 7.5 Embedding Math

- **Cosine Similarity**: `dot(a, b)` where `a` and `b` are L2-normalized (so cosine similarity = dot product). Clamped to [-1, 1].
- **L2 Normalization**: `v[i] / sqrt(sum(v[j]²))` — ensures unit-length vectors.
- **Averaging Embeddings**: Element-wise mean of N embeddings, then L2-normalize the result.
- **Thresholds**: 80% base core match (quality-aware up to 82%), 88% strong core-match override (with consistency), 86% minimum core similarity for adaptive enrollment, 65% for same-person validation.

### 7.6 Sharpness Analysis (Anti-Screen-Photo)

1. Crop raw image to face bounding box region.
2. Resize to 64×64 for fast computation.
3. Convert to grayscale using standard luminance weights (0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B).
4. Apply 3×3 Laplacian kernel: `[0 1 0 / 1 -4 1 / 0 1 0]`.
5. Compute variance (mean of squared Laplacian values).
6. If variance < 15.0: reject as possible photo-of-screen.

## 8. Security Features

### 8.1 Liveness Detection (Anti-Spoofing)

| Check | Method | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| **Smile Challenge** | ML Kit `smilingProbability` — user must smile during check-in liveness challenges | ≥ 55% |
| **Blink Challenge** | ML Kit `leftEyeOpenProbability` + `rightEyeOpenProbability` — state machine detects open→closed→open transition | < 30% (closed), > 50% (open) |
| **Angle Challenges** | ML Kit `headEulerAngleY` (yaw) + `headEulerAngleX` (pitch) — user must turn face to specified directions | Target ranges per FaceAngle enum |
| **Sharpness Analysis** | Laplacian variance on face region — photos of screens have lower edge contrast | ≥ 15.0 |
| **Eye Openness** | ML Kit `leftEyeOpenProbability` + `rightEyeOpenProbability` — both-eyes-closed suggests a still photo | ≥ 40% each |
| **Multi-Face Rejection** | If >1 face detected, reject (prevents showing a group photo) | Exactly 1 face |
| **Guide Alignment Gate** | Face must be aligned to the face guide before registration/check-in steps can progress | Centered + front-camera face ratio checks |

### 8.2 Back Camera Prevention

The app uses the Flutter `camera` package to programmatically select the front camera. The `CameraController` is initialized with `CameraLensDirection.front`. Additionally, **post-capture validation** is still applied:

| Check | Logic | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| **Face Size Ratio** | `faceArea / imageArea` — front-camera selfies have large faces; back-camera shots have smaller faces | ≥ 6% |
| **Face Centering** | Face center must be within ±30% of image center — selfies are centered | Within bounds |
| **Camera Selection** | `CameraController` initialized with `CameraLensDirection.front` | Programmatic (not just a hint) |

### 8.3 Same-Person Validation (Registration Integrity)

During multi-capture registration (5 photos, each at a different angle):

| Check | Logic | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| **Inter-Capture Similarity** | Each new embedding is compared against all previously stored captures via cosine similarity | ≥ 65% |
| **Failure Handling** | If a different person is detected, a prominent dialog warns the user and the capture is rejected (user can retry the same capture) | N/A |

### 8.4 Face Quality Gates

Every face capture (registration and check-in) passes through quality checks:

| Quality Check | Condition | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Face too far | `faceRatio < 5%` | -40 score, rejected |
| Face a bit far | `faceRatio < 10%` | -20 score |
| Face too close | `faceRatio > 70%` | -20 score |
| Excessive yaw | `abs(yaw) > 25°` | -30 score |
| Slight yaw | `abs(yaw) > 15°` | -15 score |
| Excessive pitch | `abs(pitch) > 20°` | -25 score |
| Excessive roll | `abs(roll) > 15°` | -15 score |
| Off-center | Face center > ±25% from image center | -20 score |
| Eyes closed | `eyeOpenProbability < 50%` | -20 score |
| **Acceptable** | `score ≥ 50` AND no "too far" issue | Pass |

## 15. Build & Deployment

### Build Command

```powershell
cd C:\Users\ciphe\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\employee_attendance
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force build -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
& "C:\flutter\bin\flutter.bat" build apk --release --target-platform android-arm,android-arm64
```

### Build Output

```
build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk  (~85.9 MB, arm/arm64 build)
```

### Environment

| Tool | Path / Version |
|---|---|
| Flutter SDK | `C:\flutter` (3.41.2, stable) |
| Android SDK | `C:\Users\ciphe\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk` (36.1.0) |
| Java | JDK 17 (via Android Studio) |
| OS | Windows 11 (25H2) |
| Project | `C:\Users\ciphe\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\employee_attendance` |

### Known Build Notes

- OneDrive sync can cause file locking during builds — clean `build/` folder first.
- If CMake/NDK configure fails in OneDrive path (for example `:app:configureCMakeRelease[arm64-v8a]`), build in a non-OneDrive path such as `C:\temp\employee_attendance_build`, then copy the APK back.
- If release fails on `:app:stripReleaseDebugSymbols` with missing `...\out\lib\x86`, build with explicit ABIs: `--target-platform android-arm,android-arm64`.
- APK size depends on ABI selection (≈85.9 MB for arm/arm64 targeted build; larger for all-ABI universal builds).
- The build uses debug signing keys — a release keystore is needed for production.

## 16. Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

| Area | Limitation |
|---|---|
| **Authentication** | Dummy — no real backend auth, any credentials work |
| **Data persistence** | No database — all attendance data is static dummy data |
| **Backend** | No API integration — app is fully offline/local |
| **Face data** | Stored in `SharedPreferences` (plain JSON) — not encrypted |
| **GPS data** | Captured but not persisted after screen closes |
| **Camera** | Uses `camera` package for live preview — full programmatic control over front camera. Angle detection, smile/blink checks done in real-time via periodic `takePicture()` calls. |
| **Single user** | Only one face can be registered at a time (single-tenant) |
| **Liveness** | Passive (smile + sharpness) — no active 3D depth or IR checks |
| **Notifications** | Static dummy data, no push notification integration |
| **Settings** | Toggle switches in Profile are non-functional |
| **APK size** | Large due to ML Kit + TFLite + camera native libs (ABI-targeted build reduces size) |
| **iOS** | Not tested or configured (Android only) |

### Suggested Future Enhancements

| Priority | Enhancement |
|---|---|
| **High** | Backend API integration (auth, attendance records, user management) |
| **High** | Real database (SQLite/Hive for local cache, REST/GraphQL for server) |
| **High** | Encrypt stored face embeddings (AES/flutter_secure_storage) |
| **High** | Production signing key for release APK |
| **Medium** | Geofencing — restrict check-in to within X meters of office coordinates |
| **Medium** | Check-out flow (currently only check-in exists) |
| **Medium** | Multiple user support / login switching |
| **Medium** | Admin dashboard (manager can see team attendance) |
| **Medium** | Leave request submission flow |
| **Medium** | Push notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging) |
| **Medium** | Add guided re-registration flow for major appearance changes (new glasses style, heavy beard changes) |
| **Low** | Active liveness (head-turn challenge, blink detection) |
| **Low** | Dark mode toggle (currently only Login/CheckIn/FaceReg use dark backgrounds) |
| **Low** | Localization (currently English only) |
| **Low** | App size reduction (split APK per ABI) |
| **Low** | iOS support |

### Face Recognition Library Research (Web, Feb 2026)

The current stack uses **ML Kit for detection** and **MobileFaceNet for identity**. From public docs/repositories reviewed:

| Option | Fit for This App | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Current (MobileFaceNet + ML Kit)** | ✅ Already integrated | Fast on-device, lightweight, but lower invariance to appearance shifts than newer SOTA embeddings. |
| **ArcFace/InsightFace family** | ✅ Strong technical candidate | Widely used high-accuracy models; robust to occlusion/appearance in many benchmarks. Integration in Flutter typically requires custom native bridge (JNI/FFI) and careful licensing review. |
| **InspireFace SDK (InsightFace ecosystem)** | ✅ Practical migration path (Android) | Cross-platform C/C++/Android SDK with detection, embedding, comparison, liveness modules. Better out-of-box tooling, but commercial use/licensing should be confirmed with vendor. |
| **DeepFace** | ⚠️ Backend-oriented | Great experimentation wrapper (many models), but Python-centric and less suitable for direct on-device Flutter embedding pipeline. |
| **ML Kit only** | ❌ Not enough for identity | ML Kit docs explicitly state it detects faces and attributes, but does **not** recognize people identities. |

**Recommended migration strategy if current improvements are still insufficient:**
1. Keep current implementation as fallback path.
2. Prototype ArcFace-class embedding model (or InspireFace SDK) in an Android native module.
3. Run A/B benchmark on real employee set (glasses on/off, beard/moustache on/off, indoor/outdoor lighting).
4. Promote the better model behind a feature flag after threshold calibration.

## 17. File-by-File Reference

### `lib/main.dart` (32 lines)
- Entry point. Calls `runApp(AttendEaseApp())`.
- Sets status bar to transparent with light icons.
- Root widget: `MaterialApp` with title "PPHL Attendance System", `AppTheme.lightTheme`, home: `LoginScreen`.

### `lib/config/theme.dart` (~190 lines)
- `AppColors`: 24 color constants + 4 gradient definitions.
- `AppTheme.lightTheme`: Material 3 theme with Poppins font, custom card/button/input/appbar/navbar themes.

### `lib/data/dummy_data.dart` (~170 lines)
- Static class with all dummy data: user profile, attendance stats, recent records, weekly hours, notifications, team members.

### `lib/services/face_recognition_service.dart` (~1048 lines)
- Singleton service handling all face recognition, liveness, camera validation, angle detection, and registration.
- New enums: `FaceAngle` (straight, left, right, up, down, unknown), `ChallengeType` (lookStraight, smile, blink, turnLeft, turnRight).
- New methods: `detectFaceAngle()`, `isTargetAngle()`, `isSmiling()`, `areEyesClosed()`, `areEyesOpen()`, `detectFacesFromInputImage()`, plus static instruction helpers.
- `registrationCaptures` changed from 3 to 5 with `registrationAngles` list.
- `checkFaceQuality()` accepts `skipRotationCheck` and applies a relaxed eye-open threshold (0.35) for angled registration captures.
- `generateEmbedding()` now performs robust embedding fusion from 4 variants (normal + mirrored + grayscale + grayscale mirrored).
- `verifyFace()` now uses weighted top-k similarity over **core registration templates** with quality-aware thresholding and minimum-hit consistency checks.
- Adaptive templates are treated as supporting signals only and cannot directly approve identity.
- Adaptive templates (`registered_face_adaptive_embeddings`, max 20, deduped) are auto-enrolled only on high-confidence core matches.
- See [Section 7](#7-face-recognition-system) for complete API documentation.

### `lib/screens/login_screen.dart` (402 lines)
- Animated login screen with PPHL GIF logo, email/password fields, dummy auth (2s delay), social login buttons.

### `lib/screens/main_shell.dart` (126 lines)
- Bottom navigation shell with 4 tabs (Home, Attendance, Alerts, Profile) using `IndexedStack`.

### `lib/screens/home_screen.dart` (545 lines)
- Dashboard with gradient header, stats row (4 StatCards), clock-in card (navigates to CheckInScreen), weekly bar chart, recent attendance list.

### `lib/screens/check_in_screen.dart` (~1318 lines)
- Live-camera check-in with randomized, dynamic liveness challenges (up to 5): look straight, smile, blink, turn left, turn right.
- Front camera preview displayed in normal non-mirrored orientation inside a human face-shaped clipped container.
- Every step is gated by face placement (center/size) before challenge logic progresses.
- Face-placement gate uses decoded captured-frame dimensions first, then fallback to preview dimensions; both normal and swapped width/height mappings are evaluated to prevent false "not centered" failures on some devices.
- Check-in centering tolerance is relaxed to ±35% to improve robustness across device camera metadata/layout differences.
- `_FaceScanProgressPainter` custom painter draws an animated clockwise progress path around the face guide.
- Green tick animation (`ScaleTransition` + `Curves.elasticOut`) on completion (including early-verified completion).
- Performs early identity verification after at least 2 completed challenges; if matched, remaining steps are skipped and GPS flow starts.
- Early verification now uses up to 2 captures and final verification uses up to 3 captures, taking the best confidence.
- If no early match, falls back to final multi-attempt verification after remaining challenges.
- Layout: fixed camera section (top), scrollable challenge/status cards (middle), fixed action button (bottom).
- Phases: initializing → scanning → verifying → gps → success | error.
- Blink detection uses a 3-phase state machine: `waitingOpen` → `waitingClosed` → `waitingReopen` → `done`.

### `lib/screens/face_registration_screen.dart` (~1000 lines)
- 5-angle live-camera face registration: straight, left, right, up, down.
- Front camera preview with face-shaped overlay (`_FaceOvalOverlayPainter`) plus animated face-path progress ring (`_FaceRegistrationProgressPainter`).
- Periodic `takePicture()` every 700ms for real-time angle detection.
- Each step is gated by placement and live quality checks before angle hold begins.
- Placement + live quality gates use orientation-robust dimension fallback to avoid being stuck on face-placement messaging when camera metadata orientation differs.
- Auto-captures when target angle is held for 2 frames (~1.4s) for improved capture clarity.
- Step indicator dots (5), capture flash animation, completion overlay.
- Same-person validation between captures (cosine similarity ≥ 65%).
- Different-person alert dialog.
